# Phase 2+ build notes

Everything after the Phase 1 vertical slice, built on the branch
`claude/sleepy-ptolemy-p7e4pm` while Phase 1 is being playtested. `main`
stays the Phase 1 build until that playtest passes; then this branch is
merged.

**Status:** code complete, **not yet played in Studio.** It passes the same
checks as Phase 1 (`./scripts/check.sh`, also run by GitHub on every push),
plus 93 unit tests.

On this branch, each with its own checklist below:
1. **Axe shop**: the Tool Shed
2. **Murph's tutorial**
3. **Trucks**: the Dealership, every truck, physics driving, Truck to lot
4. **Daily goals and streaks**

Old saves carry over: new save fields are filled in on load. Play the
sections in order the first time (a fresh save gets the tutorial).

## Try this build

```sh
git fetch
git checkout claude/sleepy-ptolemy-p7e4pm
rojo serve
```
Then connect from Studio as usual. `git checkout main` goes back to the
Phase 1 build.

## Axe shop (GAME_DESIGN §8 phase 2)

The **Tool Shed** stands west of the sawmill (left of it as you walk up
from spawn). At the counter, **Browse axes** opens the shop screen:

- Every axe on the ladder, with its damage and the toughest woods it fells
  (the Steel Axe: "Fells oak in 3 · birch in 5 · pine in 13").
- The next axe has a **Buy** button (green when you can afford it). Axes
  you own can be bought again, for a collection. Later axes say **Locked**
  until you buy the one before; the Starfall Axe says **Forged**.
- Buying takes the cash, puts the axe in your hotbar and in your hand.
- Walking away (or the X, or B on a gamepad) closes the screen.

The server checks everything again: that you're at the counter, that the
axe is next in line, and your cash. You can own at most
`GameConfig.MaxOwnedAxes` (20) axes.

### Playtest checklist
- [ ] The Tool Shed is west of the sawmill; **Browse axes** shows at the counter
- [ ] The screen lists all 9 axes; Rusty says Starter, Steel has a price,
      Hardened and later say Locked, Starfall says Forged
- [ ] With less than $150, clicking Steel's price says how much more you need
- [ ] With $150+: the button turns green; buying takes $150, and the Steel
      Axe is in your hand and hotbar; oak now falls in 3 hits
- [ ] Steel's row now says "you own 1"; the Hardened Axe is buyable next
- [ ] Buy a second Steel Axe: two in the hotbar, "you own 2"
- [ ] Walk away: the screen closes; the prompt comes back when you return
- [ ] Leave + rejoin: bought axes are still there (needs API access)
- [ ] `/giveaxe gold` (Studio test axe) does **not** unlock Cobalt in the shop
- [ ] Toasts show on top of the shop screen
- [ ] Phone (device emulator): the screen fits and scrolls; buttons are tappable
- [ ] `[Stopwatch] … First upgrade bought at …` prints after the first buy

## Murph's tutorial (GAME_DESIGN §11)

**Murph** (big beard, red flannel, beanie) stands just ahead of the spawn.
New players get one objective at a time in a tracker on the left,
with Murph's line under it and an amber arrow over what to do next:

1. Chop down a tree (arrow on the nearest tree)
2. Pick up a log (nearest log)
3. Load logs into your truck (your truck)
4. Sell logs at the sawmill (the sell pad)
5. Sell 18 more logs: Murph chips in **$25**
6. Buy the Steel Axe at the Tool Shed (the Tool Shed counter)

**Skip tutorial** (tap twice) ends it; **Talk** at Murph repeats his line.
Progress is saved, so a rejoin carries on where you left off. Saves from
before the tutorial that already own a better axe skip it.

Balance note: with the $25, the model has players affording the Steel Axe
at ~9 min (design target 12–15). Connor chose to keep the bonus
(2026-09-30); ECONOMY.md flags those two early rows, and that's expected.

### Playtest checklist
- [ ] New save (or reset: see below): the tracker shows step 1 of 6, Murph's
      line appears, the arrow bounces over a nearby tree
- [ ] Each step advances the moment you do it; the arrow moves to the next thing
- [ ] Step 5 counts logs as you sell ("(6/18)"), then "Murph chipped in $25!"
- [ ] Buying the Steel Axe ends it: the tracker goes, Murph says goodbye
- [ ] Rejoin mid-tutorial: same step and progress
- [ ] Skip (tap twice): the tracker goes and doesn't come back after rejoining
- [ ] **Talk** at Murph repeats his current line
- [ ] The tracker sits on the left, below the chat window; on a phone it
      stays clear of the thumbstick (Murph's card may dip toward it: tap
      the card to dismiss)
- [ ] `[Stopwatch] … Finished the tutorial at …` prints at the end

To see the tutorial again with an old save: with API access off (or a new
test account), progress starts fresh each Play session.

## Screen layout

- **Cash, top right**, with the Daily Goals button under it.
- **Tutorial tracker, left**, a third of the way down, under Roblox's chat
  window.
- Roblox's own **player list is off** (it opens top right on computers,
  over the cash) until the game has its own leaderboard. Turn it back on
  with `ShowRobloxPlayerList = true` in `GameConfig.luau`.

### Playtest checklist
- [ ] Cash shows top right on a computer and on a phone, clear of Roblox's
      menu buttons; no Roblox player list covering it
- [ ] The tutorial tracker is on the left and doesn't cover the chat

## Trucks: Dealership and physics driving (GAME_DESIGN §8 phase 4)

- **Every truck is real now:** Rustbucket, Pickup, Scout ATV, Flatbed and
  Logging Rig, each its own size and colour, built from ItemCatalog. Beds
  fill with visible logs. Bigger beds drive slower (top speeds 24 to 40).
- **Dealership** east of the sawmill (opposite the Tool Shed): **Browse
  trucks** lists every truck with its bed and top speed. Buy one and it
  replaces your truck in your parking spot, load and all if it fits. Trucks
  you own show **Use** to switch back. The Scout ATV has no bed.
- **Physics driving:** trucks collide with trees and buildings instead of
  gliding through them. Your device drives your truck (smooth, no lag);
  the server checks it never goes faster than it can. Getting out parks it
  where it is. Set `VehiclePhysics = false` in `GameConfig.luau` to get
  the Phase 1 arcade driving back if physics misbehaves.
- **Truck to lot:** a button (right edge) when your truck is far away:
  it goes back to your parking spot with its load. 10 s cooldown.
- The parking lot is bigger (slots fit the Logging Rig).

### Playtest checklist
- [ ] The Rustbucket spawns on its slot with its wheels on the ground, not
      floating or sunk
- [ ] Drive with WASD / arrows: it speeds up, turns, reverses, stops when you
      let go. It bumps into trees and walls instead of passing through
- [ ] Hop out while rolling: it stops where it is and stays put; nobody can
      push it around
- [ ] Load logs at the tailgate; they show in the bed; sell at the mill
- [ ] Dealership: **Browse trucks** shows 5 trucks; the Rustbucket says
      **In use**; buying the Pickup ($1,200) takes the cash and the Pickup
      appears in your spot; the Rustbucket now says **Use**
- [ ] Switch with logs in the bed: the load moves over (if it fits)
- [ ] Walk far from your truck: **Truck to lot** appears; press it: the truck
      is back in your spot with its load; pressing again right away says to wait
- [ ] Phone (device emulator): drive with the thumbstick; the Truck to lot
      button doesn't cover the jump button
- [ ] A second player (Test → 2 players) can drive your truck, and it moves
      smoothly for both
- [ ] Output has no `[AntiExploit] … truck moved` warnings during normal driving
      (if it does, tell Claude: the speed check is too strict)
- [ ] If physics driving feels bad: set `VehiclePhysics = false` and report
      what went wrong

Numbers to tune after this playtest (all in `GameConfig.luau` /
`ItemCatalog.luau`): `VehicleAccel` 14, `VehicleBrake` 40, `VehicleCoast` 8,
each truck's `topSpeed` and `turnRate`.

## Daily goals and streaks (GAME_DESIGN §12)

A **DAILY GOALS 0/3** button sits under your cash, top right. Tap it for
today's three goals, e.g. "Fell 4 trees", "Sell 12 logs", "Sell 6 birch logs", "Earn
$60 selling logs", "Load 12 logs into your truck", with progress bars and
rewards. Each goal pays when done; all three pay a bonus that grows with
your **streak** (days in a row, up to 2x at 5 days). Goals are sized to
your best axe, reset at midnight UTC (the panel counts down), and a missed
day resets the streak.

### Playtest checklist
- [ ] The button shows under the cash with "0/3"; tapping opens the goals
- [ ] Felling, loading and selling move the right bars; a finished goal
      toasts "Daily goal done … +$15" and turns green
- [ ] Finishing all three: "All daily goals done! +$30. Streak: 1 day."; the
      button turns green and shows the streak
- [ ] Rejoin the same day: same goals, same progress
- [ ] "New goals in …" counts down to midnight UTC
- [ ] Phone: the button and panel fit under the cash and close with a tap

To test a new day without waiting: temporarily change `SecondsPerDay` in
`DailyData.luau` to `300` (a "day" every 5 minutes), then set it back to
`86400`.
