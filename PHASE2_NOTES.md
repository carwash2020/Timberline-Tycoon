# Phase 2+ build notes

Everything after the Phase 1 vertical slice, built on the branch
`claude/sleepy-ptolemy-p7e4pm` while Phase 1 is being playtested. `main`
stays the Phase 1 build until that playtest passes; then this branch is
merged.

**Status:** code complete, **not yet played in Studio.** It passes the same
checks as Phase 1 (`./scripts/check.sh`).

## Try this build

```sh
git fetch
git checkout claude/sleepy-ptolemy-p7e4pm
rojo serve
```
Then connect from Studio as usual. `git checkout main` goes back to the
Phase 1 build.

## Axe shop (GAME_DESIGN §8 phase 2)

The **Tool Shed** stands west of the sawmill (left of it as you walk up
from spawn). At the counter, **Browse axes** opens the shop screen:

- Every axe on the ladder, with its damage and the toughest woods it fells
  (the Steel Axe: "Fells oak in 3 · birch in 5 · pine in 13").
- The next axe has a **Buy** button (green when you can afford it). Axes
  you own can be bought again, for a collection. Later axes say **Locked**
  until you buy the one before; the Starfall Axe says **Forged**.
- Buying takes the cash, puts the axe in your hotbar and in your hand.
- Walking away (or the X, or B on a gamepad) closes the screen.

The server checks everything again: that you're at the counter, that the
axe is next in line, and your cash. You can own at most
`GameConfig.MaxOwnedAxes` (20) axes.

### Playtest checklist
- [ ] The Tool Shed is west of the sawmill; **Browse axes** shows at the counter
- [ ] The screen lists all 9 axes; Rusty says Starter, Steel has a price,
      Hardened and later say Locked, Starfall says Forged
- [ ] With less than $150, clicking Steel's price says how much more you need
- [ ] With $150+: the button turns green; buying takes $150, and the Steel
      Axe is in your hand and hotbar; oak now falls in 3 hits
- [ ] Steel's row now says "you own 1"; the Hardened Axe is buyable next
- [ ] Buy a second Steel Axe: two in the hotbar, "you own 2"
- [ ] Walk away: the screen closes; the prompt comes back when you return
- [ ] Leave + rejoin: bought axes are still there (needs API access)
- [ ] `/giveaxe gold` (Studio test axe) does **not** unlock Cobalt in the shop
- [ ] Toasts show on top of the shop screen
- [ ] Phone (device emulator): the screen fits and scrolls; buttons are tappable
- [ ] `[Stopwatch] … First upgrade bought at …` prints after the first buy
